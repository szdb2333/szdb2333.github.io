作为我实际意义上创建的第一个网站，尽管绝大部分都是AI辅助的（甚至还包含一些从朋友那里“剽窃”来的代码），我也认为这次的实验是有意义的
我在此归档，是因为我不愿再维护这样一个早期的项目（或许连项目都称不上），也希望这个继续存在来在未来作为可能的过去的证明

As the first website I've practically built from scratch—despite the fact that most of it was AI-assisted (and even included some code “borrowed” from friends)—I still consider this experiment worthwhile.
I'm archiving this because I no longer wish to maintain such an early project (if it can even be called that), and I hope its continued existence will serve as evidence of a possible past.
